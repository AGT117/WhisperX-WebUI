1
00:00:01,364 --> 00:00:11,256
I've seen the summers,

2
00:00:11,736 --> 00:00:13,497
the fall and winters

3
00:00:14,118 --> 00:00:22,928
Reaching for the moon I've walked a thousand miles just to be here

4
00:00:22,949 --> 00:00:26,172
And not a day too soon

5
00:00:27,452 --> 00:00:31,379
Looking back at the life that we had,

6
00:00:31,879 --> 00:00:34,343
the things that we've been through.

7
00:00:36,286 --> 00:00:38,628
Remember this day,

8
00:00:38,649 --> 00:00:43,496
as I go my way, that leads me back to you.

9
00:00:44,677 --> 00:00:46,521
When the lights don't place,

10
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,643
the music fades,

11
00:00:49,145 --> 00:00:52,869
and I've done all I can do.

12
00:00:53,542 --> 00:00:57,512
Don't be afraid to walk alone

13
00:00:58,014 --> 00:01:03,146
Cause I'm on my way to you

14
00:01:30,075 --> 00:01:34,260
Soon a new face will take up my place,

15
00:01:34,581 --> 00:01:39,126
a circle will renew.

16
00:01:39,146 --> 00:01:43,689
Another chapter, forever after,

17
00:01:43,709 --> 00:01:46,674
I know I'll see you soon.

18
00:01:47,474 --> 00:01:49,275
When I lost no place,

19
00:01:49,796 --> 00:01:51,438
the music fades,

20
00:01:51,959 --> 00:01:55,543
and I've done all I can do.

21
00:01:56,367 --> 00:02:00,272
Don't be afraid to walk alone

22
00:02:00,813 --> 00:02:23,606
Cause I'm on my way to you

23
00:02:32,242 --> 00:02:36,241
Don't be afraid to walk alone

24
00:02:36,703 --> 00:02:40,700
Cause I'm on my way to you
